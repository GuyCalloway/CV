**Full stack junior software developer**
Having started the  journey to becoming a software developer, I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy. Excited by the creative framework that coding provides to break a problem down, solve it and optimise this solution, I cant wait to keep improving this skills somewhere in the ever expanding world of tech!
Whether analysing data during my masters, setting up a site for a sustainable clothing company or using music production and performance tools, knowledge of coding and software could have greatly streamlined my processes. Looking forward I am motivated and passionate about realising some of this great potential. 

## Skills

#### Analytical thinking & problem solving

-  When researching high purity Chromiums mechanical properties for its potential use in Fusion reactors, being adaptable was crucial when coming up with practical solutions when equipment failed, or to prepare samples of an extremely difficult and brittle material.

- Using knowledge of Javascript and statistics to apply standard deviation to data collected real time by SYNE application. Involved working out how to pass information out of a running animation loop to be analysed and passed back in. 

- 5 kyu level on Codewars after completing 36 Kata of increasing difficulty

#### Collaboration and Communication
- Contributing to agile workflow, and using 2/3 day sprints in my final project. Making sure each team member was working on an area of the product that played to their strengths or was in area where they had highlighted to improve in.
-   Having clear manageable goals and open communication channels during tech projects for example using morning check ins, stand ups and a group trello boards for splitting tickets and tracking progress. The importance of these was highlighted when working in a range of team environments during Maker's projects. Creating a git wiki was also extremely useful in making sure the whole team had a solid understanding of the code base. 
- Collaborating with small like minded businesses when creating Banzhu, or learning from fellow researchers/finding time to catch senior researchers during my masters research project, I learnt to balance busy schedules and made sure to time-box and prioritise issues. 
- Overseeing the presentation, formatting and grammar of the team design project required meet ups and check ins on progress througout the project.
- Most of all I enjoy team work and positively contributing to my work environment!
